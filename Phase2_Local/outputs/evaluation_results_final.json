    "question": "What specific failures does the 'AfroBench' paper identify in current LLMs?",
    "answer": "The 'AfroBench' paper identifies that current LLMs, especially open models, are biased towards English and a few high-resource languages, resulting in large performance gaps when compared to African languages. The performance of LLMs on African languages remains a hurdle, with significant disparities based on the availability of monolingual data resources. Additionally, there is a need for better adaptation techniques to improve performance on African languages.",

    "answer": "The 'Cheetah' paper proposes to handle 517 African languages by developing a massively multilingual language model specifically designed for natural language generation (NLG) in these languages. Cheetah is trained on a 42G multi-domain corpus that includes diverse sources such as news articles, health documents, religious texts, legal documents, and social media feeds. This approach addresses the scarcity of NLG resources for African languages and supports linguistic diversity by enabling practical NLG applications for African communities. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations across six generation downstream tasks, where it significantly outperforms other models in five of the six tasks.",

AfriCOMET also leverages transfer learning from well-resourced DA data and uses an African-centric multilingual pre-trained encoder, AfroXLM-R, to build more effective MT evaluation and QE models for African languages. Additionally, AfriCOMET-STL surpasses the cutting-edge COMET22 system across all three correlation coefficients, and AfriCOMET-QE systems significantly outperform the state-of-the-art CometKiwi system.",

It fosters a collaborative online community through weekly meetings, an active Slack workspace, and a GitHub repository, allowing individuals to train and share neural machine translation models without requiring academic prerequisites [source_28]. In contrast, 'NLLB' focuses on interdisciplinary collaboration and transparency, aiming to include diverse expertise and open-source its efforts to foster community involvement. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the cultural and political environments of low-resource language communities and aims to maximize social gains while minimizing risks [source_13].",
